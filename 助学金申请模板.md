我目前是地质学专业的一名学生，一直以来，我们的科学研究都围绕着传统地质勘查，缺乏有效的矿产预测手段。

在我的国家，人工智能的发展迅速，但是在地质领域的应用仍然很少。我们的学校没有开设地质与人工智能结合的课程，由于疫情封控，其他大学禁止外校人员进入。

目前中文网上的免费资源匮乏，加上我是学生，没有经济来源，家境贫寒，难以负担昂贵的学费，很难获取良好的学习资源。

我注意到这门课程是有关Supervised Machine Learning的，这是人工智能的基础。基于上述原因，我想要申请助学金，希望能给我这个机会，谢谢！


I am a student majoring in geology at present. For a long time, our scientific research has been focused on traditional geological exploration, and there is a lack of effective means of mineral prediction.

In my country, the development of artificial intelligence is rapid, but the application in the field of geology is still very few. Our school does not offer courses combining geology and artificial intelligence. Due to the lockdown of the epidemic, other universities forbid foreign staff to enter. 

At present, there is a shortage of free resources on the Chinese Internet. Besides, as a student, I have no financial resources and my family is poor, so it is difficult for me to afford expensive tuition fees and obtain good learning resources.

I noticed that this course is Supervised Machine Learning, the foundation of artificial intelligence. Based on the above reasons, I would like to apply for the grant. I hope you can give me this opportunity. Thank you!

我认为机器学习可以为人工智能找矿提供新思路。而机器学习是引领我入门的第一步，而监督学习和非监督学习是机器学习的基础。通过这门课我可以学习到机器学习的基础知识并学会如何运用。同时，在我的学习过程中，我意识到我的学习方法不系统，我总是改变我的学习方式，使我的效率很低。我希望这门课能帮助我改善这些状况。
所有这些技能对我未来的专业发展都是必不可少的，也可以帮助我在毕业后找到工作。希望您能同意我的申请。期待您的回复。

I think machine learning can provide new ideas for AI mining. Machine learning is the first step to introduce me, and supervised learning and unsupervised learning are the foundation of machine learning. Through this course, I can learn the basic knowledge of machine learning and learn how to use it. At the same time, in my learning process, I realized that my learning method is not systematic, I always change my learning way, which makes my efficiency very low. I hope this course can help me improve these conditions.
All these skills are essential for my future professional development and can also help me find a job after graduation. I hope you can agree with my application. Looking forward to your reply.
